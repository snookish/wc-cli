I was walking through the park, feeling the cool breeze, when I noticed a small group of friends chatting.
One of them was holding a book titled "Мечта" (Russian for "Dream").
The girl beside him smiled and said, "오늘 날씨 정말 좋아요!" (Korean for "The weather is really nice today!").
Nearby, a boy was practicing his "空手" (Japanese for "karate") moves, his movements smooth and precise.
It felt like the perfect day, where different cultures and languages came together in harmony.
