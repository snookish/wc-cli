The girl beside him smiled and said, "오늘 날씨 정말 좋아요!" (Korean for "The weather is really nice today!"). Nearby, a boy was practicing his "空手" (Japanese for "karate") moves, his movements smooth and precise. It felt like the perfect day, where different cultures and languages came together in harmony.
